# Java Essential Learning Resources
This repo is an essential Java learning resource that has been created by **[Nick Barty](https://github.com/nickbarty)**

# IMPORTANT
The point of this repo is to **read and understand** the code so you can conceptualise how you can extrapolate the constructs into your own projects

The repo contains many examples of basic Java constructs, all of which can be found in the **_[AllConceptExampls](https://github.com/NickBarty/Java_Learning_Resources/blob/master/AllConceptExamples.java)_** class

Advanced concepts can be found within their own class file (E.g. **_[GuiLayoutExample](https://github.com/NickBarty/Java_Learning_Resources/blob/master/GuiLayoutExample.java)_**)

# How To Use This Repo
1. Open the repo in Jetbrains Intellij IDE
2. Open the concept file you want to learn
3. If your using the **_[AllConceptExampls](https://github.com/NickBarty/Java_Learning_Resources/blob/master/AllConceptExamples.java)_** class, un-comment the method call to the concept you want to learn within the **main()** method and **CTRL + Click** the method call to find it 
4. **Learn!!**

## Extra
There are also some basic questions that have been created to test your basic knowledge of code constructs within Java. They can be found under the Questions.docx file and the answers can be found under the QuestionAnswers file
